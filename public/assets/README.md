- **Style**: Realistic, warm, inviting

### ü™ë Core Elements

#### 1. Wooden Desk/Table
- **Material**: Rich mahogany or oak wood texture
- **Details**: Natural wood grain, subtle reflections
- **Position**: Centered, takes up ~70% of frame width
- **Lighting**: Warm desk lamp casting soft shadows

#### 2. Open Book with Page Flipping
- **Position**: Center of desk, slightly angled
- **Animation**: Slow, natural page turns (3-4 seconds per flip)
- **Details**:
  - Book spine with title embossed
  - Yellowed pages with printed text
  - Realistic paper texture and shadows
  - Gentle flutter when turning

#### 3. Coffee Mug with Steam
- **Position**: Right side of desk

- **Curtains**: Light fabric in background
- **Animation**: Gentle swaying motion
- **Lighting**: Warm sunlight filtering through
- **Atmosphere**: Dust particles floating in light beams

## üé¨ Animation Sequence

### Timeline (8-second loop):
1. **0-2s**: Static scene establishing shot
2. **2-5s**: Book page slowly turns with realistic motion
3. **5-6s**: Steam rises from coffee mug
4. **6-8s**: Curtains sway gently in breeze
5. **8s**: Loop back to beginning

### Movement Details:
- **Book Pages**: Smooth 180¬∞ rotation with paper physics
- **Steam**: Curved upward motion with varying opacity
- **Curtains**: Sine wave motion, subtle and calming
- **Lighting**: Subtle flicker to simulate natural light

## üõ†Ô∏è Creation Tools

### Recommended Software:
1. **Blender** (Free, Professional)
   - 3D modeling and animation
   - Realistic physics simulation
   - Particle effects for steam/dust

2. **Adobe After Effects**
   - Advanced animation controls
   - Professional rendering

3. **Procreate + Adobe Photoshop**
   - Digital painting approach
   - Frame-by-frame animation

### Free Alternatives:
- **Krita** (Digital painting)
- **GIMP** (Image editing)
- **Pencil2D** (2D animation)

## üìÅ File Specifications

### GIF Output:
- **Format**: GIF (89a)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Frame Rate**: 24 FPS
- **Colors**: 256 colors (optimized palette)
- **File Size**: Target < 2MB for web performance

### Optimization:
- Use color quantization
- Remove unnecessary frames
- Apply dithering for smooth gradients

## üéØ Placement in App

### File Location:
```
ui/public/assets/animated-study-scene.gif
```

### Integration Code:
```tsx
backgroundImage: 'url("/assets/animated-study-scene.gif")'
backgroundSize: 'cover'
backgroundPosition: 'center'
opacity: 0.15 // Adjust for text readability
```

## üé® Design Guidelines

### Color Palette:
- **Warm Browns**: #8B4513, #A0522D (wood)
- **Cream Whites**: #F5F5DC, #FFF8DC (paper)
- **Warm Light**: #FFE4B5, #FFDAB9 (sunlight)

### Lighting:
- **Primary**: Warm desk lamp (orange tint)
- **Secondary**: Soft window light (golden hour)
- **Ambient**: Subtle blue bounce light

### Textures:
- **Wood**: Visible grain, natural imperfections
- **Paper**: Slight yellowing, subtle texture
- **Fabric**: Soft folds, natural drape

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Web Optimization:
1. **Compress GIF**: Use tools like EzGIF or ImageOptim
2. **Reduce Colors**: 256 colors maximum
3. **Crop Empty Space**: Focus on active elements
4. **Test Loading**: Ensure < 2MB file size

### App Integration:
- **Lazy Loading**: Load only when needed
- **Fallback**: Gradient background if GIF fails
- **Responsiveness**: Scales properly on all devices

## üìã Quality Checklist

### Before Export:
- [ ] Realistic wood texture and lighting
- [ ] Smooth book page turning animation
- [ ] Natural steam rising from coffee
- [ ] Gentle curtain movement
- [ ] Proper color balance and contrast
- [ ] No jarring movements or effects

### Technical:
- [ ] 1920x1080 resolution
- [ ] 24 FPS smooth animation
- [ ] Under 2MB file size
- [ ] Optimized color palette
- [ ] Seamless loop

## üé≠ Alternative Approaches

If creating a custom GIF is too complex:

### Option 1: Stock Footage
- Search for "study room animation" on stock sites
- Edit to match your requirements
- Ensure licensing allows commercial use

### Option 2: Video to GIF
- Find suitable study room video
- Convert to GIF with proper timing
- Adjust colors to match your theme

### Option 3: CSS Animation Fallback
- If GIF doesn't work, fallback to subtle CSS animations
- Book opening/closing with CSS transforms
- Steam effect with CSS particles

## üéØ Final Result

The animated GIF should create a **warm, inviting atmosphere** that makes users feel comfortable and focused, perfectly complementing the RAG application's purpose of helping with document analysis and learning.

The scene should feel like a **personal study space** where someone is deeply engaged in reading and research - exactly the kind of environment where BookMate would be most useful!
